# perplexity-ai

A Perplexity AI desktop application wrapped with Electron to be used on my NixOS machine.

## Bonus Functionality

Use `perplexity-ai --new-thread` to navigate to the New Thread page (home page) to start a new search/thread. Works on the Perplexity window that is already open or creates a new one.

This can be binded to a key (e.g. through Hyprland config) to create quick access to Perplexity AI search.
